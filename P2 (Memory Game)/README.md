## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Description

Memory Game is a browser-based card-matching game to exercise your memory, built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JScript.

## Setup

The game board consists of a grid composed of 16 cards (8 pairs), each with a symbol on one side. The cards are shuffled on the grid with the face down. 
Push the reset button to restart the game (shuffle the cards and turn them face down again).


## Gameplay

Rules: turn over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
