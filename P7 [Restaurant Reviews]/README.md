# FEND Certification Course


## Specification

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I was tasked to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.
To run the project, download or clone the repository on your computer and follow the instructions regarding the live server if you do not have one already set up.

### Project code

You can find the original project code [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1), feel free to compare it with this version.

### Setting up a Live Server

Start a simple HTTP server to serve the site files on your computer. 
Download and install the latest version of Python from their [website] (https://www.python.org/).
Navigate to the project folder.
Start the server using -m http.server 8000.
Visit the site here: http://localhost:8000.

There are many other options to view the site, but for live development and editing purposes I chose not to implement the Python server, but instead opted to use an extension available in Visual Studio Code [Live Server 5.6.1]. I used the 127.0.0.1:5500 port. This can easily be changed in the dbhelper.js file to whatever address and port your server lives on.


### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
